# MEGA4
MEGA4 is a 4-Port USB 3.1 PPPS (Per-Port Power Switching) hub designed for Raspberry Pi 4B. It adds 4 more USB 3.1 ports to Raspberry Pi 4B, and the power on each port can be turned ON or OFF separately via software.

MEGA4 has the same board size as Raspberry Pi 4B, and can be mounted underneath. The U-shaped adapter (included) can make data and power connection between MEGA4 and Raspberry Pi.

MEGA4 is also a powered hub and you can connect 5V power supply to its USB type C connector and significantly increase its current output ability.

You can turn on/off the power on each USB port via the software or via UUGear Web Interface (UWI) on PC, Tablet or Smartphone.

Although MEGA4 is designed for Raspberry Pi 4B, you can use it as a USB 3.1 hub on other computers. You may want to use a USB3.1 extension cable for the connection.
